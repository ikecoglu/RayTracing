# RayTracing

This repository demonstrates a simple ray tracing setup initially developed for the Boun Photonics Lab.

Both the original MATLAB scripts and a Python port are provided.

## MATLAB version

Run the `RayTracing.m` script from MATLAB or Octave to reproduce the demo.

## Python version

Install the required libraries and execute `ray_tracing.py`:

```
pip install matplotlib numpy
python ray_tracing.py
```

The Python workflow mirrors the MATLAB example by drawing an object, passing rays through a lens and mirror, and finally plotting the result.
